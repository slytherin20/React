## Q:  Role of type attribute in script? What are its different types?
A: Type attribute helps browser identify the type of script it needs to execute.
Different types:
**Module:** Using this type makes script be treated as a module. Module scripts require use of CORS protocol for cross-fetching of data.
**Classic script:**  Empty string passed in type, no type declared or a JS MIME type  makes the script be treated as a classic script.
**Import map:** Its is a JSON object that developers can use to control how browsers resolve module specifiers when importing JS modules.
**Data block:** The embedded content is treated as a data block and wonâ€™t be processed by browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not javascript MIMI to indicate the data blocks.
